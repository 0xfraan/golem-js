/**
 * This advanced example demonstrates how to perform all market interactions "manually".
 * It should give you a basic understanding of how this SDK works under the hood.
 * If you're just getting started with golem-js, take a look at the basic examples first.
 * Keep in mind that this is not the recommended way to interact with the Golem Network, as
 * it doesn't cover all edge cases and error handling. This example should be used for educational purposes only.
